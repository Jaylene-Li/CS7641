## Proposal


### Introduction/Background

### Problem Definition


### Methods

We may start our training from the simplest linear model (Ridge regression). However, the dataset of stocks contains a lot of noise and the prices of the stocks are not linearly distributed. Therefore, we may need a more complex model to train the dataset.
The most intuitive method is using a decision tree. However, the stock dataset is so complex that we need to avoid overfitting. There are two kinds of advanced decision tree model:

+ Random Forest
+ XGBoost

The basic idea of Random Forest is building several trees and merging them together. The advantage is, the Random Forest model can almost fit any data, including linear and nonlinear models. Also, it behaves well when there is lots of missing data. In the meanwhile, the disadvantages also exist: the Random Forest models are easy to become overfit when there are too much noises in the dataset.
